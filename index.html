        <h2 id="question">What was the death impact of Ashoka to the community?</h2>
        <p id="text1">After Ashoka's death, the Mauryan empire was disappearing. There were just a few generations after Ashoka's reign that lived, and they too were being declined from the community. The very last person of the Mauryan dynasty is named Brihadratha. He was murdered by his general. The work that Ashoka was trying to achieve, was discontinued, meaning that all the peace and prosperity that Ashoka was trying to bring to the Indian community, was abandoned, and something else was put into place. But Ashoka is remembered for what he was trying to achieve and the big difference it was going to make to the Indian community and more (Ashoka did not just try and spread peace throughout India, he wanted to spread peace throughout neighbouring land and countries.).</p>
